# Object Browser Plugin

This adds an object menu for inserting Vanilla objects into the patch when right clicking anywhere on the patch. Right click and see 'add object' entry.

I don't plan to officially release this plug in but incorporate it into the Pd Vanilla distribution by default. This is just for experimental tests.

To install: add tcl files to Pd's search path and start/restart Pd.
